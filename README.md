# NAO_with_RPi
control NAO robot with a Raspberry Pi

## Goal
This project was born with the idea of controlling NAO robot from a Raspberry Pi

The NAO robot has a limited computing power, so it is necessary to extend its power with external boards.  
We choose the Raspberry Pi because it is very widespread and offers much computing power, general purpose and modularity in a very confined space.

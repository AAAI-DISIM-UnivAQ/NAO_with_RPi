# NAO_with_RPi
control NAO from a RaspberryPi through defined interfaces

## Goal
The project goal is to control NAO robot from a RaspberryPi

The NAO robot has a limited computing power,
so it becomes necessary to extend its power with external computers.  
We chose the RaspberryPi because it is a widespread general purpose board,
and offers a lot of computing power within a very confined space and costs.  

Despite the above, we constructed the project as modular as possible,
so that whatever computer can be used instead of a Raspberry,
as long as it satisfies the software requisites.

## Requisites

### Hardware
* NAO robot from Aldebaran
